# E.coli-outbreak
de novo assembly and annotation of bacterial genomes

In April 2011, hundreds of people in Germany were hospitalized with hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS), a deadly blood disease that often starts as food poisoning with bloody diarrhea and can lead to kidney failure. German health officials immediately informed the World Health Organization about the incident, but they had no idea that it was the beginning of the deadliest E. coli outbreak in recent history, caused by a mysterious strain that we will call E. coli X. Within a few months, the bacterium had infected thousands and killed 53. But where did it come from?

The workflow will be to answer the following questions:
1) What is the genome sequence of E. coli X?
2) What strain of E. coli is E. coli X most similar to? (Where did it come from?)
3) What are the genes that E. coli X contains?
4) Which of these genes make E. coli X distinct?
5) How did E. coli X evolve to obtain these genes?
6) How did E. coli X become pathogenic?
